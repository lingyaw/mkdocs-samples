# Visualization Guidelines
## What you must know before building any reports 
How does our brain understand information? Our brain prioritizes its attention based on five cognitive principles
 
 01. Not in Order 
 Our brain always looks at visual elements first and searches for contextual elements second
 
 02. What stands out
 We always notice first what stands out regardless of where it is located on a screen
 
 03. Just a few things
 The average attention span is of 8 seconds. We can only look at a few things at once
 
 04. Meaning and Connections
 Our brain understands information by interpreting proximity, similarity, enclosure, closure, continuity, and connectivity
 
 05. Conventions and metaphors
 Depending on the culture, certain forms, colors, and shapes have preexisting meaning that our brain uses
 
# Introduction to Creating Visuals
## Creating good visualizations is dependent on clearly defining the target audience and the purpose of visualization

Target Audience: Each type of audience has its own requirements and therefore a good visualization is always tailored to one specific target audience
Clear Purpose: The purpose of the visualizations we create is what should determine how things are shown to the audience
Visual Grammar, and Context: To appeal to the audience and fulfill its purpose, visuals need to have the right combination of visual elements and aesthetics

## General Timeline to Visuals
To achieve the intended results, it is necessary to spend an appropriate amount of time at each visualizatio phase

## Prep [10%]: 
- The right space
Focus on the task at hand
Get a quiet room & minimize interruptions
Bring the correct material
- Keep the data away
Do not lead with the data
Think about the big picture
Brainstorm
- Write down the basics
Who is the target audience?
What is the setting for the use of this visual?
What is the purpose of the visual?

## Talk & Listen [30%]
- Listen to a friendly outsider
Select an unbiased person
Explain the basics
Have a flexible approach
- Get challenged by an insider
Explain all the details
Act as a “double check”
Challenge your approach
- Ask Specific Questions
What are we trying to achieve?
When will this be used?
Who will be in charge of the visual?

## Design & Sketch [30%]
- Use notes to define context
Data driven or conceptual visual?
Univariable or Multivariable?
Static or Time-changing?
- Match notes to visuals
Group all the notes
Identify converging ideas
Match ideas to specific visuals
- Sketch the visuals
Work fast and try several options
Do not focus on real values or scales

## Prototype & Build [30%]
- Paper Prototyping
Use paper or whiteboards
Should be a more serious sketch
Use simpler visuals
- Digital Prototyping
Use software
Input more information
Use rapid prototyping techniques
- Paired Prototyping
Execute with business and data experts
Encourage active collaboration

# The layers of the visual
## Once the purpose is clear, we need to define the characteristics of the visual through 8 layers

01. Data Mapping
Principal variables define the way the data is mapped. Time should always be mapped to the X-axis

02. Coordinate System
Coordinate systems alter the way data is interpreted. Business visuals usually work better with lineal scales.

03. Geometry
Different shapes communicate different things. Do not use lines if the data is not showing a sequence.

04. Scaling
The way data is scaled might change the meaning of what is shown. Scale data to be comparable.

05. Aesthetic Shape
Some times, shapes are required to identify attributes. Always go for simple shapes and never more than 6.

06. Aesthetic Color
Color can communicate different messages. Main use of color should be to emphasize the main idea.

06. Aesthetic Size
Size communicates magnitude but interpreting it can be tricky. Use size as a general indication not specific one.

06. Aesthetic Facets
Grouping data can hide important messages. Use facets to break down data and reveal different patterns.

# Building a Dashboard
## Collective Purpose 
We must define an overall objective so all visuals can contribute to it, dashboards should always be Data Driven
